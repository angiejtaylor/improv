    "rules": "Players stand in a circle. One player starts by clapping their hands, pointing at another player, and saying 'Zip'. The pointed player must immediately respond by doing the same to another person while saying 'Zap', and the third person continues with 'Zop'. The pattern continues cycling 'Zip', 'Zap', 'Zop'. If anyone hesitates, speaks out of order, or says the wrong word, they\u2019re out. Last person standing wins, or restart after a few rounds for fun."
